Verifying installation
######################


.. note:: These verification steps require MATLAB®. `UCAR Member Institutions
          <https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/membership-governance/member-institutions>`_
          have access to institutional licenses for MATLAB, thus we have
          created verification tools using it.

The Lorenz model is notoriously sensitive to very small changes; in
fact, the story of Lorenz discovering this sensitivity is a classic in
the annals of the study of chaos, which in turn was instrumental in the
development of data assimilation as a field of study. See :doc:`The Lorenz 63
model: what is it and why should we care? <lorenz-63-model>` or :doc:`What is
data assimilation? <introduction-ensemble-da>` for more information.

This sensitivity is of practical interest for verifying these results.
The initial conditions files and observations sequences are provided in
ASCII, which is portable across systems, but there may be some
machine-specific round-off error in the conversion from ASCII to machine
binary. As Lorenz 63 is such a nonlinear model, extremely small
differences in the initial conditions may eventually result in
noticeably different model trajectories. Even different compiler flags
may cause tiny differences that ultimately result in large differences.
Your results should start out looking VERY SIMILAR and may diverge with
time.

The simplest way to determine if the installation is successful is to
run some of the functions available in ``DART/diagnostics/matlab/``.
Usually, we launch MATLAB from the ``DART/models/lorenz_63/work``
directory and use the MATLAB *addpath* command to make the
``DART/matlab/`` functions available for execution in any working
directory.

In the case of this Lorenz model, we know the "true" (by definition)
state of the model that is consistent with the observations, which was
generated by the *perfect_model_obs* program as described in `Checking
the build — running something <#runningSomething>`__. The following
MATLAB scripts compare the ensemble members with the truth and can
calculate the error in the assimilation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd DART/models/lorenz_63/work
   $  matlab -nodesktop

From the above ``plot_ens_time_series`` graphic, you can see the
individual green ensemble members becoming more constrained with less
spread as time evolves. If your figures look similar to these, you
should feel confident that everything is working as intended. Don’t miss
the opportunity to rotate the "butterfly" plot for that classic chaos
theory experience (perhaps while saying, "life, uh, finds a way").
